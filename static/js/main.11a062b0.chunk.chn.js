The purpose of the Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them. It does not prescribe specific key performance indicators, measurement methods, or the disclosure of individual matters, but does include a small number of requirements that are to be applied before an integrated report can be said to be in accordance with the Framework.",

Dialogue participants will work together to refine overlapping metrics. SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB will map their frameworks against the TCFD recommendations and identify opportunities for alignment of metrics where possible across all their reporting frameworks taking into account the different focuses and audiences. This work will be conducted in the context of supporting further integration of financial with non-financial reporting, through identifying how the non-financial metrics relate to financial outcomes and how these can be integrated in mainstream reports.',

The purpose of the Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them. It does not prescribe specific key performance indicators, measurement methods, or the disclosure of individual matters, but does include a small number of requirements that are to be applied before an integrated report can be said to be in accordance with the Framework.",

The organization\u2019s that make up the Corporate Reporting Dialogue are CDP, Climate Disclosure Standards Board, Financial Accounting Standards Board (observer), Global Reporting Initiative, International Accounting Standards Board, International Integrated Reporting Council, International Organization for Standardization, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.\n\nCorporate Reporting Dialogue participants are working together on the "Better Alignment project" to better align the frameworks in the sustainability reporting space (SASB, GRI, CDP) and frameworks that promote further integration between non-financial and financial reporting (IIRC, CDSB). Dialogue participants will work together to refine overlapping metrics. SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB will map their frameworks against the TCFD recommendations and identify opportunities for alignment of metrics where possible across all their reporting frameworks taking into account the different focuses and audiences. This work will be conducted in the context of supporting further integration of financial with non-financial reporting, through identifying how the non-financial metrics relate to financial outcomes and how these can be integrated in mainstream reports.',

Dialogue participants will work together to refine overlapping metrics. SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB will map their frameworks against the TCFD recommendations and identify opportunities for alignment of metrics where possible across all their reporting frameworks taking into account the different focuses and audiences.

The purpose of the Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them. It does not prescribe specific key performance indicators, measurement methods, or the disclosure of individual matters, but does include a small number of requirements that are to be applied before an integrated report can be said to be in accordance with the Framework.",

Dialogue participants will work together to refine overlapping metrics. SASB, GRI, CDP and CDSB will map their frameworks against the TCFD recommendations and identify opportunities for alignment of metrics where possible across all their reporting frameworks taking into account the different focuses and audiences. This work will be conducted in the context of supporting further integration of financial with non-financial reporting, through identifying how the non-financial metrics relate to financial outcomes and how these can be integrated in mainstream reports.',

The Framework was released following extensive consultation and testing by businesses and investors in all regions of the world, including the 140 businesses and investors from 26 countries that participated in the IIRC Pilot Programme. The purpose of the Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them. It does not prescribe specific key performance indicators, measurement methods, or the disclosure of individual matters, but does include a small number of requirements that are to be applied before an integrated report can be said to be in accordance with the Framework.",

An issuer must report on the over 20 "comply or explain" provisions of a special ESG Reporting Guide (Appendix 278 of the main Board Listing Rules). If the issuer does not report on one or more of these provisions, it must provide reasons in its ESG report. The issuer is encouraged, but not required, to report on the additional approximately 20 recommended disclosure factors. These reporting provisions make the HKEX one of the few exchanges requiring companies to provide more transparency into ESG performance and risks and providing a framework to do so.',

They debate and find consensus (norms) on technical topics, as well as share best practices.\n\nBy involving the whole value chain \u2014 from a policymaker to asset owners \u2014 the IMP facilitated consensus about the definition of impact. Impact can be deconstructed into five dimensions: What, Who, How Much, Contribution and Risk. To make impact management a reality, the IMP has developed a set of categories underpinned by the five dimensions. These 15 impact categories enable enterprises and investors to set goals and assess performance.",

Two of these benchmarks are:\n\nCorporate Climate Action Benchmark: This benchmark will assess and compare the climate action performance of companies across three high carbon-emitting industries: oil and gas, electric utilities and automotive, measuring corporate climate action performance of the 90 largest listed and state-owned companies within these three high carbon-emitting industries. By making the benchmark free and accessible to all, governments, investors, consumers, and civil society can exert their influence to improve corporate climate action performance.\n\nWBA is developing the Gender Equality and Empowerment Benchmark (GEEB). This benchmark will assess and compare how companies in a select group of industries promote gender equality and empowerment. In particular, it covers how they contribute to SDG 5, a goal set to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.",

In addition to the Protocol, the supplementary document "Connecting Finance and Natural Capital: A Supplement to the Natural Capital Protocol\u2019 provides a framework for financial institutions to assess the natural capital impacts and dependencies of their investments and portfolios. This framework has been developed by the Natural Capital Coalition (the Coalition), Natural Capital Finance Alliance (NCFA) and the Dutch SIF VBDO.',

By making the benchmark free and accessible to all, governments, investors, consumers, and civil society can exert their influence to improve corporate climate action performance.\n\nWBA is developing the Gender Equality and Empowerment Benchmark (GEEB).

They debate and find consensus (norms) on technical topics, as well as share best practices.\n\nBy involving the whole value chain \u2014 from a policymaker to asset owners \u2014 the IMP facilitated consensus about the definition of impact. Impact can be deconstructed into five dimensions: What, Who, How Much, Contribution and Risk. To make impact management a reality, the IMP has developed a set of categories underpinned by the five dimensions. These 15 impact categories enable enterprises and investors to set goals and assess performance.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

It encourages investors to use responsible investment to enhance returns and better manage risks, but does not operate for its own profit; it engages with global policymakers but is not associated with any government; it is supported by, but not part of, the United Nations.\n\nThe principles: The six Principles for Responsible Investment are a voluntary and aspirational set of investment principles that offer a menu of possible actions for incorporating ESG issues into investment practice.",

IFC \u2014a sister organization of the World Bank and member of the World Bank Group\u2014is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",

They debate and find consensus (norms) on technical topics, as well as share best practices.\n\nBy involving the whole value chain \u2014 from a policymaker to asset owners \u2014 the IMP facilitated consensus about the definition of impact. Impact can be deconstructed into five dimensions: What, Who, How Much, Contribution and Risk. To make impact management a reality, the IMP has developed a set of categories underpinned by the five dimensions. These 15 impact categories enable enterprises and investors to set goals and assess performance.",

The Framework was released following extensive consultation and testing by businesses and investors in all regions of the world, including the 140 businesses and investors from 26 countries that participated in the IIRC Pilot Programme. The purpose of the Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the fundamental concepts that underpin them. It does not prescribe specific key performance indicators, measurement methods, or the disclosure of individual matters, but does include a small number of requirements that are to be applied before an integrated report can be said to be in accordance with the Framework.",

IFC developed standards and principles from the lenses of a development finance institution.\n\nIFC's Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability: Since 2006, these performance standards define  IFC clients' responsibilities (investee responsibilities) for managing their environmental and social risks. The standards have become globally recognized good practice in dealing with environmental and social risk management. The EPs have helped spur the development of other responsible environmental and social management practices in the financial sector and banking industry\n\nEquator Principles:  These principles serve as a risk management framework, adopted by financial institutions since 2003, for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk in four financial products 1) Project Finance Advisory Services 2) Project Finance 3) Project-Related Corporate Loans and 4) Bridge Loans and is primarily intended to provide a minimum standard for due diligence and monitoring to support responsible risk decision-making.\n\nOperating Principles for Impact Management: The Principles describe the essential features of managing investment funds with the intent to contribute to measurable positive social or environmental impact, alongside financial returns. This goes beyond asset selection that aligns investment portfolios with impact goals (for example, the SDGs), to requiring a robust investment thesis of how the investment contributes to the achievement of impact.",
